# Sorting_algoritm_visualizer
This Pygame-based sorting algorithm visualization project demonstrates various sorting algorithms in real-time using visual representations of rectangles with different heights. Each rectangleâ€™s height corresponds to a data point, and as the sorting algorithm progresses, you can visually see the sorting in action.

Sorting Alogithms Used
1.Selection Sort
2.Merge Sort
3.Bubble Sort
4.Insertion Sort
5.Quick Sort
